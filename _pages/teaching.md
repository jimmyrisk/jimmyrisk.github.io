As a teacher, I value student interaction and constant observation of my audience.  Peer evaluators stated that I have [teacher noticing](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00405841.2016.1173996).  More and more research being done indicates that teacher noticing is a previously understudied component of effective pedagogy.

I believe this comes from my extensive experience in one-on-one tutoring (with students of undergraduate and graduate levels), and general desire to help and understand my audience.
