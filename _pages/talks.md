I have travelled worldwide to give academic talks, often attending the [International Longevity Risk and Capital Markets Solutions Conference (Longevity)](https://www.bayes.city.ac.uk/faculties-and-research/centres/pensions-institute/events/longevity-16) currently held by Bayes Business School in the University of London.  For example, I have visited Lyon France, Chicago USA, and Amsterdam Netherlands through this conference alone.

Below is a full list of talks I have given, with slides and/or documents if applicable.
