I have travelled worldwide to give academic talks, often at the [International Longevity Risk and Capital Markets Solutions Conference (Longevity)](https://www.bayes.city.ac.uk/faculties-and-research/centres/pensions-institute/events/longevity-16) (Lyon France, Chicago USA, Amsterdam Netherlands) currently held by Bayes Business School in the University of London.

Below are a full list of talks I have given, with slides and/or documents if applicable.

## Invited Lectures

My research primarily focuses on **Gaussian processes** (GPs), a Bayesian non-parametric based modelling method.  I have used GPs as a tool in a variety of disciplines including

* [How Random Was That? (An Introduction to Statistical Modelling)](Science_On_Tap_F21.pdf). **Science on Tap (Cal Poly Pomona College of Science)**. *October 2021*.
* [The Role of a Kernel in Statistical Learning]().  **UC Riverside Applied Statistics Colloquium**. *March 2021*. 
* [](). **AMS Sectional Meeting; Special Session on Markov Processes, Gaussian Processes and Applications in San Francisco, CA**.  *October 2018*.
* [An Interactive R Markdown Approach to Mortality Rate and Improvement Modeling using Gaussian Process Models]().  **Fourteenth International Longevity Risk and Capital Markets Solutions Conference in Amsterdam**. *September 2018*. 
* [Gaussian Process Models for Mortality Rates and Improvement Factors]().  **Twelfth International Longevity Risk and Capital Markets Solutions Conference in Chicago**. *September 2016*.
* [Statistical Emulators \& Longevity Risk](). **Actuarial Research Conference (ARC), University of Toronto**. *August 2015*.
* [Statistical Emulators \& Longevity Risk](). **Eleventh International Longevity Risk and Capital Markets Solutions Conference at Universite Lyon 1, Lyon, France**. *September 2015*.
