## Research Interests

My research primarily focuses on **Gaussian Processes (GPs)**, a Bayesian non-parametric modeling method, which I apply across various disciplines. I am particularly interested in the following areas:

* **Gaussian Processes and Applications**: Exploring novel covariance functions to enhance the expressivity and interpretability of GPs, enabling their use in diverse applications such as image super-resolution and advanced classification tasks in computer vision.

* **Financial Mathematics and Quantitative Risk Management**: Investigating GP-based techniques for risk assessment and option pricing, including quantile loss estimation and efficient Monte Carlo simulations. I am also interested in modeling liquidity dynamics in decentralized finance platforms and integrating GPs with stochastic volatility models.

* **Actuarial Science and Mortality Modeling**: Utilizing GPs and genetic algorithms to develop nuanced mortality models that capture age-period-cohort effects. This approach aims to improve the precision and interpretability of mortality forecasts essential for insurance and pension planning.

* **Sports Analytics and Mathematical Finance**: Creating innovative player valuation frameworks by combining financial models with network theory to assess player market values dynamically. Additionally, I explore the application of stochastic control methods to optimize team performance strategies throughout a season.

* **Machine Learning and Data Science**: Focusing on kernel expressivity and model interpretability within machine learning. I design novel covariance functions to better capture complex data structures, facilitating transparent and interpretable solutions in areas such as image processing and classification.

A key aspect of my research is bridging robust statistical methodologies with modern data-driven applications, ensuring that solutions are both transparent and interpretable.
